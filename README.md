## Background:
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women  since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.
The Bellabeat keeps track of health data related to users activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions.

The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.

The company has 5 focus products: bellabeat app, leaf, time, spring and bellabeat membership. Our team have been asked to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. The insights we discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
