## 2. Prepare
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)

### 2.1 Information about Data Source:
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 April 2016 to 12 May 2016.
The dataset has 18 CSV.
30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
Data collected includes: information about daily activity, steps, distance, heartrate and sleep monitoring that can be used to explore user's habits.


### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.
- Upon further investigation with ```n_distinct()``` to check for unique user Id, the set has 33 user data from daily activity, 24 from sleep and only 8 from weight. There are 3 extra users and some users did not record their data for tracking daily activity and sleep. 
- For the 8 user data for weight, 5 users manually entered their weight and 3 recorded via a connected wifi device (eg: wifi scale).
- Most data is recorded from Tuesday to Thursday, which may not be comprehensive enough to form an accurate analysis.


### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

- Reliable - LOW - Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents >>The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data and generated by from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
- Original - LOW - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk) >> The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data via Amazon  Mechanical Turk.
- Comprehensive - MED - Parameters match most of Bellabeat's products' parameters >> Data minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While the data tracks many factors in the user activity and sleep, but the sample size is small and most data is recorded during certain days of the week. 
- Current - LOW - Data is 8 years old and is not relevant >>Data is from March 2016 to May 2016. Data is not current so the users habit may be different now. 
- Cited - LOW - Data collected from third party, hence unknown
Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.


### 2.4 Data Selection:
The following file is selected and copied for analysis.
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- sleepDay.csv
- weightLogInfo.csv
- hourly(steps,calories,intensities)_merged csv
    
### 2.5 Tools:
- R for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation and Data Analysis
- Tableau for Data Visualization

## 3. Process
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)

- In this step, we check for Data Integrity, accuracy, duplicates, incomplete, and nulls.
- Data Validation: includes checking data types, data ranges, and other constraints.
- Data manipulation to make it more organized
- merge data if needed
- refer FitbitAnalysis.Rmd file for process steps using R.

### 3.1 Check For NA
```{r}
sum(is.na(daily_activity))
sum(is.na(sleep_day))
sum(is.na(weight))
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
sum(is.na(hourly_intensities))
sum(is.na(hourly_calories))
# sum(is.na(heartrate))
## We will leave the NA. The NA belongs to "Fat" data of different dates.
```
### 3.2 Check for duplicates and remove duplicates
```{r}
cat("Number of duplicate rows in daily_activity before removal:", nrow(daily_activity[duplicated(daily_activity),]), "\n")
daily_activity <- daily_activity[!duplicated(daily_activity),]
cat("Number of duplicate rows in daily_activity after removal:", nrow(daily_activity[duplicated(daily_activity),]), "\n") 
# Confirm duplicates removed
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))
```
#### Repeat the above code chunk for all csv that we need

### 3.3 Convert character columns to date
[Back to Process](#3-process)

```{r}
daily_activity$ActivityDate <- as.Date(daily_activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
sleep_day$SleepDay <- as.Date(sleep_day$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
weight$Date <- as.Date(weight$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```
#### Use the below date format to extract hours from hourly data
```{r} 
hourly_steps$ActivityHour <- as.POSIXct(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p") # Convert ActivityHour to POSIXct (24-hour format )
hourly_steps$Date <- as.Date(format(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) # Extract Date
hourly_steps$Hour <- format(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%H")  # Character # Extract the hour
hourly_steps$Hour <- as.numeric(hourly_steps$Hour)            # Convert to numeric (0-23)
write_csv(hourly_steps, "hourly_steps.csv")                 # Check result
```
### 3.4 Add a new column for the weekdays
[Back to Process](#3-process)
```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% mutate( weekday = weekdays(as.Date(ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y")))
```
### 3.5 Clean column names
[Back to Process](#3-process)
```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% clean_names()
sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% clean_names()
weight <- weight %>% clean_names()

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>% clean_names()
hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>% clean_names()
hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>% clean_names()

## View updated column names
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(sleep_day)
colnames(weight)
colnames(hourly_steps)
colnames(hourly_intensities)
colnames(hourly_calories)

```
### 3.6 merge daily_activity, sleep and weight data
[Back to Process](#3-process)

```{r}
merged1 <- merge(daily_activity,sleep_day,
                  by.x = c("id", "activity_date"), 
                  by.y = c("id", "sleep_day"),
                  all=TRUE)
merged_data <- merge(merged1, weight, 
                      by.x = c("id", "activity_date"), 
                      by.y = c("id", "date"),
                      all=TRUE)

#save csv for future use
write_csv(merged_data, "merged_data.csv")

# Check head, NA, duplicates, distinct id in merged data.
head(merged_data)
glimpse(merged_data)
sum(is.na(merged_data))
sum(duplicated(merged_data))
n_distinct(merged_data$id)

# similarly merge hourly steps, intensity and calories data (for code check FitbitAnalysis.Rmd file)
```
### 3.7 Examine the dataset and check if all 30 users are unique.
[Back to Process](#3-process)

#### Check to see if all users are unique.We supposed to have 30 users or 30 IDs. So We have 3 extra from daily activity, 6 less from the sleep day table, and 22 less from the weight table. 
```
n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$id)
n_distinct(weight$id)
```
#### Since weight table only has 8 users enter their information. Let's take a look at how they enter the information. 5 users are manually reporting the weight and 3 uers are reporting it with a connected device - wifi connected scale. 
```
weight %>% 
  filter(is_manual_report == "True") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise("Manual Weight Report"=n()) %>%
  distinct()

weight %>% 
  filter(is_manual_report == "False") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise("Manual Weight Report"=n()) %>%
  distinct()
```

## 6. Act
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)
   
Here, we revisit our business questions and share with you our high-level business recommendations.
    
**1. What are the trends identified?**
  
* The majority of users (81.3%) are using the Fitbit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.
    
* Users prefer to track their activities during weekdays as compared to weekends - perhaps because they spend more time outside on weekdays and stay in on weekends.
   
**2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?**
    
* Both companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit, and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well be applied to Bellabeat customers.
    
**3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?**
    
* Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggesting different types of exercise (ie. simple 10 minutes exercise on weekdays and a more intense exercise on weekends), and calories intake and burnt rate information on the Bellabeat app.
  
* On weekends, the Bellabeat app can also prompt notifications to encourage users to exercise.
