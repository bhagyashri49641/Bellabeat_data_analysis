## 2. Prepare
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)

### 2.1 Information about Data Source:
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 April 2016 to 12 May 2016.
The dataset has 18 CSV.
30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
Data collected includes: information about daily activity, steps, distance, heartrate and sleep monitoring that can be used to explore user's habits.


### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.

### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

- Reliable - **LOW** - Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents 
- Original - **LOW** - Third-party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
- Comprehensive - **MED** - The parameters closely align with those of Bellabeat's products, including minute-level data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Although the data tracks various aspects of user activity and sleep, the sample size is limited.
- Current - **LOW** - Data is 9 years old so the user's habit may be different now. 
- Cited - **LOW** - Data collected from third party
Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.


### 2.4 Data Selection:
The following file is selected for analysis.
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- sleepDay.csv
- weightLogInfo.csv
- hourly(steps,calories,intensities)_merged csv
    
### 2.5 Tools:
- R for Data Cleaning, Data Transformation and Data Analysis
- Tableau for Data Visualization

## 3. Process
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)

- In this step, we check for Data Integrity, accuracy, duplicates, incomplete, and nulls.
- Data Validation: includes checking data types, data ranges, and other constraints.
- Data manipulation to make it more organized
- merge data if needed
- refer FitbitAnalysis.Rmd file for process steps using R.

### 3.1 Check For NA
```{r}
sum(is.na(daily_activity))
sum(is.na(sleep_day))
sum(is.na(weight))
sum(is.na(hourly_steps))
sum(is.na(hourly_intensities))
sum(is.na(hourly_calories))
## We will leave the NA. The NA belongs to "Fat" data of different dates.
```

### 3.2 Check for duplicates and remove duplicates
```{r}
cat("Number of duplicate rows in daily_activity before removal:", nrow(daily_activity[duplicated(daily_activity),]), "\n")
daily_activity <- daily_activity[!duplicated(daily_activity),]
cat("Number of duplicate rows in daily_activity after removal:", nrow(daily_activity[duplicated(daily_activity),]), "\n") 
# Confirm duplicates removed
sum(duplicated(daily_activity))

#### Repeat the above code chunk for all CSV that we need
```
![image](https://github.com/bhagyashri49641/Bellabeat_data_analysis/blob/53d16ced004aa68f0efc85014e357dc2697aa308/Plots/check_and_remove_duplicates.png)

### 3.3 Examine the dataset and check if all 30 users are unique.
[Back to Process](#3-process)

Check to see if all users are unique. We are supposed to have 30 users or 30 IDs. So We have 3 extra from daily activity, 6 less from the sleep day table, and 22 less from the weight table. 
```
n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
n_distinct(sleep_day$id)
n_distinct(weight$id)
```

### 3.4 Convert character columns to date
[Back to Process](#3-process)

In available CSV's we have date column as character but for analyzing the data on the basis of date we need to convert it into date format furthermore, different CSV's have different date formats dd-mm-yyyy, 
mm-dd-yyyy and some dates with time so we separate dates into mm-dd-yyyy in all CSV's and also extract Hour from the date column for hour-based calculations.
```{r}
daily_activity$ActivityDate <- as.Date(daily_activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
sleep_day$SleepDay <- as.Date(sleep_day$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
weight$Date <- as.Date(weight$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
```
Use the below date format to extract hours from hourly data
```{r} 
hourly_steps$ActivityHour <- as.POSIXct(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p") # Convert ActivityHour to POSIXct (24-hour format )
hourly_steps$Date <- as.Date(format(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) # Extract Date
hourly_steps$Hour <- format(hourly_steps$ActivityHour, format = "%H")  # Character # Extract the hour
hourly_steps$Hour <- as.numeric(hourly_steps$Hour)            # Convert to numeric (0-23)
write_csv(hourly_steps, "hourly_steps.csv")                 # Check result
```
### 3.5 Add a new column for the weekdays
[Back to Process](#3-process)

```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% mutate( weekday = weekdays(as.Date(ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y")))
```
### 3.6 Clean column names
[Back to Process](#3-process)
```{r}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% clean_names()
sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% clean_names()
weight <- weight %>% clean_names()

hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>% clean_names()
hourly_intensities <- hourly_intensities %>% clean_names()
hourly_calories <- hourly_calories %>% clean_names()

## View updated column names
colnames(daily_activity)
colnames(sleep_day)
colnames(weight)
colnames(hourly_steps)
colnames(hourly_intensities)
colnames(hourly_calories)
```

### 3.7 merge daily activity, sleep and weight data
[Back to Process](#3-process)

```{r}
merged1 <- merge(daily_activity,sleep_day,
                  by.x = c("id", "activity_date"), 
                  by.y = c("id", "sleep_day"),
                  all=TRUE)
merged_data <- merge(merged1, weight, 
                      by.x = c("id", "activity_date"), 
                      by.y = c("id", "date"),
                      all=TRUE)

# Save CSV for future use
write_csv(merged_data, "merged_data.csv")

# Check head, NA, duplicates, distinct id in merged data.
head(merged_data)
glimpse(merged_data)
sum(is.na(merged_data))
sum(duplicated(merged_data))
n_distinct(merged_data$id)

# similarly merge hourly steps, intensity and calories data (for code check FitbitAnalysis.Rmd file)
```
### 3.8 Examine Weight data
Since weight table only has 8 users enter their information. Let's take a look at how they enter the information. 5 users are manually reporting the weight and 3 uers are reporting it with a connected device - wifi connected scale. 
```
weight %>% 
  filter(is_manual_report == "True") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise("Manual Weight Report"=n()) %>%
  distinct()

weight %>% 
  filter(is_manual_report == "False") %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  summarise("Manual Weight Report"=n()) %>%
  distinct()
```
## 4. Analyze
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)

- make sense of the given data
- refer FitbitAnalysis.Rmd file for analyzing steps using R.

### 4.1 Summary
Check min, max, mean, median and any outliers.
Avg weight is 135 pounds with BMI of 24 and burn 2050 calories. Avg steps is 10200, max is almost triple that 36000 steps. Users spend on avg 12 hours a day in sedentary minutes, 4 hours lightly active, only half hour in fairly+very active! Users also gets about 7 hour of sleep. 
```
merged_data %>%
  dplyr::select(
         total_steps,
         total_distance,
         very_active_minutes,
         fairly_active_minutes,
         lightly_active_minutes,
         sedentary_minutes,
         calories,
         total_minutes_asleep,
         total_time_in_bed,
         weight_kg,
         bmi
         ) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  summary()

hourly_merge %>%
  dplyr::select(
                hour,
                step_total,
                calories,
                total_intensity,
                )%>%
  na.omit() %>%
  summary()
```

![summary](link of screenshot :I need to run code and get this again)

### 4.2 Data Distribution over the week
```
most_data_recorder_on <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarise(record_count = n(), .groups = "drop")
glimpse(most_data_recorder_on)

most_active_days <- ggplot(data=most_data_recorder_on, aes(x=weekday, y=record_count))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill="#CD69C9")+
  labs(title="Data distribution over the week")+
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("Data_distribution_over_the_week.png", plot = most_active_days, width = 6, height = 3, dpi = 200) #plot1
```
we can see that from Tuesday to Thursday most of the data is being recorded by the users.

### 4.3 Active Minutes:
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)

```
percentage <- data.frame(
  level=c("Sedentary", "Lightly", "Fairly", "Very Active"),
  minutes=c(sedentary_percentage,lightly_percentage,fairly_percentage,active_percentage)
  )

plot_ly(percentage, labels = ~level, values = ~minutes, type = 'pie',textposition = 'outside',textinfo = 'label+percent',
        marker = list(colors = c("#FF4500", "#1E90FF", "#32CD32", "#FFD700"))) %>%
          layout(title = 'Activity Minutes Percentage',
          xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
          yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE)
          )
```
Percentage of active minutes in the four categories: very active, fairly active, lightly active and sedentary. From the pie chart, we can see that most users spent 81.3% of their daily activity in sedentary minutes and only 1.74% in very active minutes. 

![newplot](https://github.com/bhagyashri49641/Bellabeat_data_analysis/blob/944e24de26fa06ef592573956ab029ca919e2eca/Plots/PieChart.png)



The American Heart Association and World Health Organization recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity, or a combination of both, each week. That means it needs an daily goal of 21.4 minutes of FairlyActiveMinutes or 10.7 minutes of VeryActiveMinutes.


In our dataset, **30 users** met fairly active minutes or very active minutes.

```
active_users <- merged_data %>%
  filter(fairly_active_minutes >= 21.4 | very_active_minutes>=10.7) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  count(id) 
glimpse(active_users)
```
### 4.4 Average Steps per Week
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)
# calculate the avg of all over steps for each weekday here group only by weekday
```
Average_Weekday_Steps <-  ggplot(data=avg_weekday_steps, aes(x=weekday, y=avg_weekly_steps, fill=weekday))+ 
                          geom_bar(stat="identity")+
                          geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_weekly_steps, 1)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
                          labs(title="Average Steps Per Day", x= "Day of the week" ,y="Average Steps")+
                          theme_minimal()
ggsave("Average_Weekday_Steps.png", plot = Average_Weekday_Steps, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 200) #plot2
```
The bar graph shows that on average 8000 steps are recorded on Tuesday and Saturday. These are the days when users are more active and take more steps.

### 4.5 Average Steps per Hour
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)

Let's look at how active the users are per hourly in total steps. From 5PM to 7PM the users take the most steps. 
```
avg_daily_steps <-  hourly_merge %>%
                    filter(step_total > 0) %>% 
                    group_by(hour) %>%
                    summarise(avg_steps = mean(step_total, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")
glimpse(avg_daily_steps)


plot6 <-  ggplot(data=avg_daily_steps, aes(x=hour, y=avg_steps, fill=avg_steps ))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_steps)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3)+
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green"))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:23) +  # Ensure all hours (0 to 23) are displayed
  labs(title="Hourly Steps", x="Hour of the Day", y="Average Steps") +
  theme_minimal()
ggsave("Average_Hourly_Steps.png", plot = plot6, width = 10, height = 5, dpi = 200)

```

### 4.6 Average of Sedentary Minutes per Day:
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)

The graph below shows that users spend 16 to 17 hours every day in sedentary, if we remove sleep time of average 8 hours still users are not much active for 8 to 9 hours each day.
also we can see that on Tuesday and Saturday people spend less time in sedentray minutes and have more step count on these days.

### 4.7 Analyzing sleep patterns
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)

#### Average sleep time per day
```
plot4 <- ggplot(data=avg_weekday_time_asleep, aes(x=weekday, y=avg_weekly_time, fill=weekday))+ 
         geom_bar(stat="identity")+
         geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_weekly_time, 1)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3) +
         labs(title="Average Asleep Time Per Day",x="Day of the week", y="Time Asleep")+
         theme_minimal()

According to article: [Fitbit Sleep Study](https://blog.fitbit.com/sleep-study/#:~:text=The%20average%20Fitbit%20user%20is,is%20spent%20restless%20or%20awake.&text=People%20who%20sleep%205%20hours,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20night.), 55 minutes are spent awake in bed before going to sleep. We have 13 users in our dataset spend 55 minutes awake before alseep. 

```
awake_in_bed <- mutate(sleep_day, AwakeTime = total_time_in_bed - total_minutes_asleep)
awake_in_bed <- awake_in_bed %>% 
  filter(AwakeTime >= 55) %>% 
  group_by(id) %>% 
  arrange(AwakeTime, desc=TRUE) 
```

#### we will check is there any effect of sedentary minutes and time asleep
```
plot13 <- ggplot(data = merged_data, aes(x = sedentary_minutes, y = total_minutes_asleep, color=total_minutes_asleep)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_gradient(low="steelblue", high="orange")+
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess', formula = 'y ~ x', color = '#005FCC') +
  labs(title = "Total Minutes Asleep vs Sedentary minutes", x = 'sedentary minutes', y = 'minutes asleep') +
  theme_classic()
ggsave("total_minutes_asleep_vs_Sedentary_minutes.png", plot = plot13, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300) #plot13
```
we can see there is negative correlation between total time asleep and sedentary minutes
The scatter plot below shows that between 0- 1500 sedentary minutes total time asleep decreases with increasing sedentary time.

### 4.8 Interesting Finds:
[Back to Analyze](#4-analyze)

- The more active you are, the more steps you take, and the more calories you will burn. This is an obvious fact, but we can still look into the data to find any interesting.
- Here we see that some users who are sedentary, take minimal steps, but are still able to burn over 1500 to 2500 calories compared to users who are more active, and take more steps, but still burn similar calories.
- This can be the effect of intensity of the workout for example less steps but one place excersice like rope jumping or cardio exercise may help users burn more calories without increase in the step count.
- This may give a hint that only counting Steps per day is not enough bellabeat needs to incorporate motion sensors into the fitness band so that it can track the activity as well as calories burned.

Comparing the four active levels to the total steps, we see most data is concentrated on users who take about 5000 to 15000 steps a day. These users spent an average between 8 to 9 hours in sedentary, 5 hours in lightly active, and 1 to 2 hour for fairly and very active. 

![image](https://github.com/bhagyashri49641/Bellabeat_data_analysis/blob/6000684cdb6b0b231a8378d4f2913ee761aa585c/active_minutes_vs_steps.png)

According to [this healthline.com article](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day#average-calorie-needs), moderately active woman between the ages of 26‚Äì50 needs to eat about 2,000 calories per day and moderately active man between the ages of 26‚Äì45 needs 2,600 calories per day to maintain his weight. Comparing the four active levels to the calories, we see most data is concentrated on users who burn 2000 to 3000 calories a day. These users also spent an average between 8 to 9 hours in sedentary, 5 hours in lightly active, and 1 to 2 hour for fairly and very active. Additionally, we see that the sedentary line is leveling off toward the end while fairly active plus very active line is curing back up. This indicate that the users who burn more calories spend less time in sedentary, more time in fairly + active.

## 6. Act
[Back to Top](#author-bhagyashri-mane)
 
In the last section of this case study, we will provide observations and suggestions based on the analysis.
To do this we refer to key questions. 
### What are some of the trends in smart device usage?
1. Based on the analysis and calculations of unique users, responders most often use FitBit to track their daily activity level and calories burned, fewer people for sleep control, and very few report information about weight.
2. Sedentary makes up a significant portion, 81% of user's daily active minutes. Users spend on average 12 hours a day in sedentary minutes, 4 hours lightly active, and only half an hour in fairly plus very active!
3. An average user walks 5.5 kilometers a day, this could be considered a moderate active lifestyle. The CDC recommends that most adults should aim for 10,000 steps per day. For most people, this is equivalent to about 8 kilometers or 5 miles.
4. We see that users take more steps on Saturday and Tuesday, burn more calories, and spend less time sedentary. Sunday is the most "lazy" day for users. There is a strong correlation between total steps taken and calories burned.
5. Users take the most steps from 7 AM to 8 AM and 5 PM to 7 PM window.
6. The average time of sleep is approximately 7 hours. This would fall within the range of recommended sleep duration for adults which is typically 7-9 hours per night.
7. There is a strong negative correlation between total time asleep and sedentary minutes. The longer the sedentary time, the stronger the association with poor sleep quality and duration. A sedentary lifestyle can lead to a decrease in overall energy expenditure, which can contribute to feelings of fatigue and daytime sleepiness.
8. 54% of the users who recorded their sleep data spent 55 minutes awake in bed before falling asleep. Saturday is the day users get the most sleep in a week.


### How could trends apply to Bellabeat customers? How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

By leveraging trends and focusing on the unique needs and behaviors of users, Bellabeat could tailor its marketing strategy to better meet the needs of its target audience and help them achieve their fitness and wellness goals.

1. Obtain more data for an accurate analysis, encouraging users to use a wifi-connected scale instead of manual weight entries.
2. Promote active lifestyle: Given that users spend a significant amount of time sedentary and are not very active, Bellabeat could focus on promoting the benefits of an active lifestyle.
3. Incorporating some of the features that can be a great way to encourage more physical activity such as goal setting (target to encourage users to aim for 10,000 steps per day or more), receiving reminders throughout the day to reach those goals
4. For improving the weight control experience successful marketing strategy should focus on promoting weight management features, such as calorie intake monitoring and meal planning to help users achieve a healthy weight.
5. creating challenges or goals that reward users for achieving specific milestones such as on Sunday people are in lazy mode so Bellabeat can give users a challenge like 'Can you dance for 10 minutes on the latest song ?'
