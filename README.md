## 2. Prepare

### 2.1 Information about Data Source:
The data set is publicly available on [Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
Generated by respondents from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 April 2016 to 12 May 2016.
The dataset has 18 CSV.
30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
Data collected includes: information about daily activity, steps, distance, heartrate and sleep monitoring that can be used to explore user's habits.


### 2.2 Limitations of Data Set:
- Data collected from year 2016. Users' daily activity, fitness and sleeping habits, diet and food consumption may have changed since then, hence data may not be timely or relevant.
- Sample size of 30 female FitBit users is not representative of the entire female population.
- As data is collected in a survey, hence unable to ascertain the integrity or accuracy of data.
- Upon further investigation with ```n_distinct()``` to check for unique user Id, the set has 33 user data from daily activity, 24 from sleep and only 8 from weight. There are 3 extra users and some users did not record their data for tracking daily activity and sleep. 
- For the 8 user data for weight, 5 users manually entered their weight and 3 recorded via a connected wifi device (eg: wifi scale).
- Most data is recorded from Tuesday to Thursday, which may not be comprehensive enough to form an accurate analysis.


### 2.3 Is Data ROCCC?
A good data source is ROCCC which stands for Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, and Cited.

- Reliable - LOW - Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents >>The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data and generated by from a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
- Original - LOW - Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk) >> The data is from 30 FitBit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data via Amazon  Mechanical Turk.
- Comprehensive - MED - Parameters match most of Bellabeat's products' parameters >> Data minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While the data tracks many factors in the user activity and sleep, but the sample size is small and most data is recorded during certain days of the week. 
- Current - LOW - Data is 8 years old and is not relevant >>Data is from March 2016 to May 2016. Data is not current so the users habit may be different now. 
- Cited - LOW - Data collected from third party, hence unknown
Overall, the dataset is considered bad quality data and it is not recommended to produce business recommendations based on this data.

The following file is selected and copied for analysis.
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- sleepDay.csv
- weightLogInfo.csv
- hourly(steps,calories,intensities)_merged csv

Here, we revisit our business questions and share with you our high-level business recommendations.
    
**1. What are the trends identified?**
  
* Majority of users (81.3%) are using the FitBit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.
    
* Users prefer to track their activities during weekdays as compared to weekends - perhaps because they spend more time outside on weekdays and stay in on weekends.
   
**2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?**
    
* Both companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well abe pplied to Bellabeat customers.
    
**3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?**
    
* Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggest different types of exercise (ie. simple 10 minutes exercise on weekday and a more intense exercise on weekends) and calories intake and burnt rate information on the Bellabeat app.
  
* On weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.
